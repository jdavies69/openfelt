# Development toolchain

Use current stable Rust, including rustfmt and Clippy, with the committed
Cargo.lock. The Quality workflow runs on Linux x86_64, Windows x86_64, and Apple
Silicon macOS. Intel macOS is deprecated and is not a supported CI or release
target. Install Rust using https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/.

## Platform prerequisites

- macOS: Apple's Command Line Tools provide the C compiler/linker needed by native
  dependencies. Run `xcode-select --install` if they are not already installed.
  Releases and CI target Apple Silicon (`aarch64-apple-darwin`).
- Windows: the normal MSVC toolchain needs the Visual Studio C++ Build Tools and
  Windows SDK. The development workstation also validated the GNU toolchain.
- Linux: install your distribution's C compiler/linker toolchain. The dedicated
  deployment was validated natively on Fedora x86_64.

## Build and test from the checkout

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features
cargo build --locked --release --bin sneakyblinders --bin poker-server
cargo run --locked --release --bin sneakyblinders
```

Run from the repository root. The explicit binary name is required: bare
`cargo run` starts the original offline game. The lockfile is required for the
same dependency selection on collaborators' computers and CI.

The existing `scripts/run_rust_gate.ps1` is an optional Windows-maintainer runner.
Its default toolchain location describes the original workstation setup; supply
its parameters for an equivalent setup or use the portable Cargo commands above.
It is not a Mac installation dependency.

## Verification boundaries

Normal tests include rules, authority/privacy, process lifecycle and TLS. Existing
ignored tests include explicit desktop attention checks and release/stress checks;
they are not claimed by a normal test pass. Invoke them individually only with
the required runtime/desktop setup. Do not indiscriminately run all ignored tests
on a headless CI runner.

Native macOS compilation/tests do not prove terminal graphics, keyboard handling
or the player's network route. Smoke-test Host/Join, a complete hand, resizing and
clean exit in the actual terminal. Start at 120x40, with at least 80x24 for gameplay.
Windows-only automatic turn focus does not run on macOS.

The Cargo warning that src/main.rs belongs to both poker and terminal-poker is
intentional compatibility with the original command names. Historical local
review logs and generated evidence are excluded from the repository.
